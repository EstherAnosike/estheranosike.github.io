<h2>The Road to Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>

Starting on a dark and dreary road, I walked past some few obstacles- broken ideas, dearth of finances, incompatible supports and the likes. falling nd rising until I found MEST, a land full of opportunities and great cultural space! <br><br>

I must clear the mind of the past. Tech enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the likes of MEST, Andela, and even Robotics!!<br><br>

Therefore MEST creates an avenue for me to train and master the important lessons of communication, business and tech in entrepreneurship. I begin to see each sector with clarity. Learning to use the technology skills in a new and maybe disruptive startups to become someone that changes the world technically<br><br>
</p>

<h2>Why MEST</h2>
<p>

I believe MEST is full of life and professional experiences that can propel me in my entrepreneurial path, which is the first steps in realizing my potentials and dreams.<br><br>

What I want to achieve at MEST is to become a great software developer creating global solutions as well as to achieve my career goals and thrive as an entrepreneur.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>My Motivation</h2>
<p>

Entrepreneurship has not been my cravings at the scratch of my personal goal but considering the vitality of tech coupled with finance to achieve success in the business world and my unfortunate experience in managing and budgeting funds since young age, my interest as an entrepreneur thus emerged.<br><br>

Even though my undergraduate degree focused largely on management and to a little extent on computer software programs. However, through my studies I became fascinated with new and emerging software development and how information and communication impacts on human development which craved the need to build a technical global solution.<br><br>

My motivation now that I have MEST to groom me is the incessant passion and the inner strength to keep me going daily because I believe that as a young entrepreneur I would be able to touch every life innovatively and live my life with as much freedom as most people probably wont have whilst creating employments for all and sundry
